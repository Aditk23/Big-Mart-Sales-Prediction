# Big-Mart-Sales-Prediction : Project Overview

## Problem Statement
The data scientists at BigMart have collected 2013 sales data for 1559 products across 10 stores in different cities. Also, certain attributes of each product and store have been defined. The aim is to build a predictive model and predict the sales of each product at a particular outlet.

Using this model, BigMart will try to understand the properties of products and outlets which play a key role in increasing sales.

## Data Visualization
Data visualization was performed and I came across various conclusions:
* 	Regular and Low fat items have almost similar sales
* 	Outlet 10 and 19 have low sales whereas 27 has highest
* 	Outletd of 1988 have low sales
* 	Grocery stores have lower sales
*	There are items with 0 visibility and suprisingly items with high visibility have low sales
*	Sales is spread evenly accross item weights
*	Only 2 actual classes are there in Item_Fat_Content
* 	Fruits and vegetables and snack foods are highest sellers
*	Less observations for outlets established in 1988
* 	Supermarket Type1 are most popular
